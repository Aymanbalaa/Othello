Welcome To Othello ! 
Navigate Through This Text File In Order To Be Able To Smoothly Test The Game

Starting A New Game :

Input  '1' in the first menu screen
Input the two players name (one at a time)
Chose a starting position (number between 1 to 5)
Press 'y' when prompted to start
The game has started !


Loading A Game :

Input  '2' in the first menu screen
Players name and board status are saved and will be loaded
The game has continued !
(You will find a loaded game in the text file already that will be overwritted when you save another game)


In Game Instructions :

Board is represented by 64 squares
and will contain 4 different signs :

* --> UNPLAYABLE 
- --> PLAYABLE
B --> OCCUPIED BY BLACK
W --> OCCUPIED BY WHITE

You can check the status of the board (count) after every move

You will be prompted to enter two integers (0 to 7) (one at a time) :
1st one represents the x axis
2nd one represents the y axis

After that your move will be played and displayed on screen

IT IS NOW PLAYER 2'S TURN 

He is prompted to enter a number '1','2' or '3'
'1' represents that player 2 forfeits the game and player 1 wins
'2' represents that player 2 saves the game and his turn
'3' represents that player 2 wishes to play his next move

Game End :
Othello ends when there are no more empty spaces on the board  
However in this version 'When laying out the board before starting,
note that the two center squares along the left column will be unplayable'
That was provided in the assignement

So position 0,3 and 0,4 will stay UNPLAYABLE during the whole game and game will end when these are the only two empty spaces left

A message will be displayed with the winner and his score or will show that its tie (very rare)
